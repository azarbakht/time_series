# Time Series (TS)

#### Used in
- control of inventory, based on demand trends
- airline's decision to buy airplanes bc of passenger trends and decision to increase/maintain market share
- climate change decisions based on temperature change trends
- business/sales forecasting
- everyday operational decisions
- long-term effects of proposed water management policies by simulating daily rainfall and sea state time series
- understanding fluctuations in monthly sales
- basis for signal processing in telecommunications <?>
- disease incidence tracking, yearly rates
- census analysis

#### Used to
- to understand the past, and predict the future
- forcasting (predicting inference, a subset of statistical inference)
- anomaly detection
- clustering
- classification (assigning a time series pattern to a specific category: e.g. gesture recognition of hand movements in sign language videos)
- query by content<?>

#### Data: 
a variable measured sequentially in time, or at a fixed [sampling] interval 

#### serial dependence problem:
observations close together in time tend to be correlated (serially dependent)

TS tries to explain this correlation (serial dependence)
autocorrelation analysis examines this serial dependence <?>

### conditions (assumptions of TS)
- stationary process ?
- Ergodic process ?
